Exercises on Social Network Analysis using R







## Exercise: Angel investors and startups on AngelList
I used ERGM model to predict funding relationships among actors (startups and investors)
Many startups use AngelList as a platform for generating traction about their companies and securing early-stage funding from angel investors. The site’s internal database contains a table that tracks how much traction, which is a measure of support for a startup’s fundraising round, a startup receives over time.
In this network, ties represent directed connections from actors (startups) to events (participants in a startup fundraising round).
