Exercises on Social Network Analysis using R

## Exercise: Network Structure in venture capital coinvestment networks
The dataset contains information on venture capital investment events, from June 1981 until July 2014.
I explored clustering and core-periphery structures using iterative correlation clustering method, and coreness (k-core) calculation.

## Exercise: Feature Similarity of Films and Productors
The dataset contains information on the films producers made and the plot keywords these films are tagged with.
In this network, keywords appeared in the same film will be linked together.
I calculated and explored similarity, distance, correlation, and cooccurance in this network.

## Exercise: Angel investors and startups on AngelList
Many startups use AngelList as a platform for generating traction about their companies and securing early-stage funding from angel investors. The site’s internal database contains a table that tracks how much traction, which is a measure of support for a startup’s fundraising round, a startup receives over time.
In this network, ties represent directed connections from actors (startups) to events (participants in a startup fundraising round).
I used ERGM model to predict funding relationships among actors (startups and investors)
