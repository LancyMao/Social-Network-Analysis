## Exercise: Feature Similarity of Films and Productors
The dataset contains information on the films producers made and the plot keywords these films are tagged with.
In this network, keywords appeared in the same film will be linked together.
I calculated and explored similarity, distance, correlation, and cooccurance in this network.
