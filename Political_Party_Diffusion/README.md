## Exercise: Political party diffusion and economic outcomes
The data is about parliamentary elections and droughts in India.
The electoral data is combined with meteorological data that details each districtâ€™s monthly level of rainfall. We used the occurrence of extreme weather events in a district as a proxy for economic disruption. We used the data to answer the question of whether abnormal levels of rainfall during the time leading up to an election cause more political parties to enter into a district during that election. We  used the data to find out whether there was a geographical diffusion process of political parties entering into districts.
I built regression model to find relationships and make predictions using R.
